  <h1>Images and comments</h1>
  <p> As the old saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. Adding images to a websites can make a big difference in its usability. In order to display an image, it has to be located on some server. One can use the same server where the HTML document is served from, or the image can be linked from elsewhere on the Internet. We’ll start with the latter option. </p>
  
<p>There are some new things inside the element, such as alt and height. These are called attributes. Each HTML element can contain attributes. Attributes are used based on the following rule:<code class="code"> name="value"</code> . That is, in order to define an attribute, you have to write its name inside an element, and give its value as a string.</p>

<p>Attributes provide additional information to an element. In the above example with the image, the src attribute defines the location of the linked image. The attribute <code class="code"> alt </code> defines what the image shows (written in a natural language such as English), and height and width determine the size of the image. Out of these four, the src and alt attributes are the most important. Without src, no image would be displayed, and without alt people viewing the page in alternative ways couldn’t know what the image shows. For example, blind people use the Internet with the help of a screen reader, which can then use the contents of the alt tag to describe the picture.</p>
